1.Introduction
1.1 Purpose:
This document is meant to delineate the features of Online Home Services(OHS),so as to serve as a guide to the developers on one hand and a software validation document for the prospective client on the other.
	The purpose of this project is to provide the common platform for both customers (users) as well as workers to fulfil their needs. The customers will visit the website and will book the service whichever required.  On the others side there are plenty of workers who have already registered on the website to serve the services requested by the customers. Once the service is booked by the customer, the system will allot this booked service to the nearby worker from customer’s address. The worker has to visit the customer’s address on the time given by the customer and has to complete the designated work. Once the requested service is complete, customer will pay the worker and worker will acknowledge about the completion of the work.

1.2 Scope
This system allows the customer’s to book services,search for particular services,cancel bookings etc.
This system allows the worker's to see if he has got any bookings,worker can notify if he is on leave,worker recieved payment or not,etc.
The system allows the admin to add or remove worker,he can add or remove one or more services,anaylsis of services,etc.
